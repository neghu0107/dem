  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is Neha. I am learning HTML to create simple and beautiful web pages. 
    This is my first paragraph on a webpage. HTML is easy to understand and fun to use!

  <p>
    With HTML, we can add headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and much more. 
    It is the building block of every website you see on the internet.
